# Stillwater Area High School Maps

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.5.

## Description

One of the first projects I ever worked on. The software is a shortest path mapping software created using the Angular Framework. It is very simple but effectively shows how a shortest path algorithm could be implemented in conjunction with a map to navigate buildings.
